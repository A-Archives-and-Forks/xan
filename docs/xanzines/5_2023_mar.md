# Xan zine: March 2024 Edition

Upgrade to the latest version using:

```bash
cargo install xan
```

## Summary

* [Dropping moonblade special identifiers](#dropping-moonblade-special-identifiers)
* [Sorted partition optimization](#sorted-partition-optimization)

## Dropping moonblade special identifiers

The `moonblade` expression language used to have a special identifier syntax, prefixed with `%` that could be used to access special values such as the current row's index through `%index`.

This tidbit has been dropped to simplify the language and to get even closer to a SQLish expression syntax.

It does not mean you cannot access the current row's index anymore, but now you will need to use the `index()` function, like with most SQL implementations.

```bash
xan map 'index()' index file.csv
# Very close to:
xan enum file.csv
```

## Sorted partition optimization

Like other `xan` commands, `partition` can now take a `-S/--sorted` flag when you know the file is already sorted on the partition column.

This makes the command both faster and able to work with less memory and resources. This also circumvents the limitation about the maximum number of files your OS is able to keep opened at once.
