## Dropping moonblade special identifiers

The `moonblade` expression language used to have a special identifier syntax, prefixed with `%` that could be used to access special values such as the current row's index through `%index`.

This tidbit has been dropped to simplify the language and to get even closer to a SQLish expression syntax.

It does not mean you cannot access the current row's index anymore, but now you will need to use the `index()` function, like with most SQL implementations.

```bash
xan map 'index()' index file.csv
# Very close to:
xan enum file.csv
```
